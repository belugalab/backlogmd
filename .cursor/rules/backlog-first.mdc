# Backlog-First Workflow

You MUST follow this order for every task:

1. **Check** `.backlogmd/backlog.md` for existing items.
2. **Create** the backlog item and tasks (using the `/backlogmd` skill) BEFORE writing any code.
3. **Mark** the task `in-progress` BEFORE starting implementation.
4. **Mark** the task `done` AFTER completing implementation.

Never skip straight to coding. The backlog is written first, always.
