This project uses [backlogmd](https://www.backlogmd.com) (`.backlogmd/`) for work tracking.

**Always use the `/backlogmd` skill to interact with the backlog.** The skill contains the mandatory workflow, spec, and all operations. Read it before starting any work.

**Keep the README spec link in sync with the latest spec version.** When `SPEC.md` is updated (version in the file header or Versioning section), update the README line that links to the spec so it shows the current version (e.g. `[Spec v4.0.2](SPEC.md)`).
