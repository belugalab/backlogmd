# Agents

This project uses [backlogmd](https://www.backlogmd.com) (`.backlogmd/`) for work tracking.

**Always use the `/backlogmd` skill to interact with the backlog.**

## Workflow (MANDATORY)

> **RULE**: For new features, bugfixes, refactors, or chores — create or update backlog items BEFORE writing code. The backlog is the source of truth for planned work. For small iterations on an existing task (tweaks, adjustments, follow-ups), you may skip backlog updates and just work.

1. **Before planning**: Check the backlog for existing items and tasks.
2. **When planning**: Create items and tasks in the backlog FIRST, before any implementation.
3. **Wait for approval**: After planning, present the plan to the user and **STOP**. Do NOT start implementing until the user explicitly approves.
4. **When starting work**: Mark the task as `in-progress` BEFORE writing code.
5. **When completing work**: Mark the task as `done` after verifying the implementation.
